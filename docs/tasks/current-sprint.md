## Notes

**Important**: This sprint board is the single source of truth for current work. Update it daily to reflect actual progress. Be honest about status - "Not Started" means not started, "In Progress" means actively working, "Complete" means tested and verified working.

**Workflow**:
1. Pick a task from backlog
2. Move to "In Progress"
3. Follow implementation guide
4. Test thoroughly
5. Update checkboxes
6. Move to "Complete"
7. Update progress metrics

**Communication**:
- Update this board daily
- Comment on blockers immediately
- Ask for help when stuck
- Celebrate completions
