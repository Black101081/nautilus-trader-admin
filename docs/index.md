**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: In Development (60% Complete)

---

## Welcome

This is the comprehensive technical documentation for the Nautilus Trader Admin Dashboard project. This documentation serves as the **single source of truth** for all development work, architecture decisions, and implementation guidelines.

---

## Project Overview

The Nautilus Trader Admin Dashboard is a modern, responsive web application for managing and monitoring Nautilus Core trading system. It replaces the legacy 16-page admin interface with a streamlined 6-page design built on reusable components.

### Key Features

**Component Library**: 8 reusable components with design tokens and TypeScript typing

**Admin Pages**: 6 simplified pages (Dashboard, Components, Features & Services, Adapters, Monitoring, Database, Settings)

**Service Layer**: 7 services with 60 methods for backend integration

**Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach supporting all device sizes

**Demo Mode**: Fallback functionality when backend is unavailable

---

## Current Status

### Completed (60%)

The following work has been completed and is production-ready:

**Phase 1 - Component Library** (100%): All 8 components built, tested, and documented with full TypeScript support and responsive design.

**Phase 2 - Page Structure** (100%): All 6 admin pages created with complete UI, navigation, and sample data display.

**Phase 3 - Service Layer** (100%): All 7 services implemented with 60 methods, error handling, and demo mode fallback.

**Phase 4 - Toast System** (100%): Notification system built and ready for integration.

### In Progress (40%)

The following work is documented but not yet implemented:

**Button Functionality Integration** (0%): Services need to be integrated into page UI with handlers, loading states, and toast notifications.

**Real API Integration** (0%): Backend APIs need to be connected when Nautilus Bridge is configured.

## Key Principles

This project follows these core principles:

**Documentation-Driven Development**: All work must be documented before implementation. This documentation is the contract.

**Honest Progress Tracking**: Progress percentages reflect actual working code, not just files created.

**Version Control**: All documentation changes are versioned in Git alongside code changes.

**Task-Based Workflow**: Work is broken down into specific, measurable tasks with time estimates.

**Testing Required**: No task is complete until tested and verified working.
